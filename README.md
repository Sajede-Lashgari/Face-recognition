Face recognition for orl database with Machine Learning algorithms

Here it is done using algorithms such as Random Forest, KNN and SVM (with diffrent kernel) a supervised problem to face recognition for orl database and
the algorithms are compared in terms of accuracy and processing time on ORL dataset and data with less dimension obtained from PCA.
Finally, with the aim of increasing the accuracy of k (10) fold cross validation used. 
It turns out that with dimensionality reduction, the processing time increases and it can almost be said that SVM algorithm has a better result.
